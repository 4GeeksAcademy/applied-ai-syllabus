## Prompt Engineering Best Practices
### What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, such as language models like GPT-4. The goal is to create prompts that elicit accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI.

Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect of interacting with AI systems. It involves designing prompts that effectively communicate the user's intent to the AI, ensuring that the responses are accurate and relevant. 

Here are some best practices to consider:

- **Clarity**: Be clear and concise. The AI should understand exactly what is being asked without any confusion.
- **Specificity**: Provide specific details when necessary to guide the AI towards the desired outcome.
- **Context**: Include relevant context that can help the AI understand the prompt within the correct framework.
- **Simplicity**: Keep the language simple and avoid jargon unless it's necessary for the task.
- **Intent**: Make sure the intent of the prompt is clear. What do you want the AI to do?
- **Feedback Loop**: Use the AI's responses to refine and improve your prompts over time.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Prompt Engineering:

- **Ambiguity**: Vague prompts can lead to irrelevant or incorrect responses. Be precise in your language.
- **Over-complication**: Don't make the prompt more complex than it needs to be. This can confuse the AI.
- **Assumptions**: Don't assume the AI has prior knowledge. Provide necessary information within the prompt.
- **Leading Questions**: Avoid prompts that lead the AI to a specific answer. Allow it to generate its own responses based on the input.
- **Neglecting Testing**: Always test your prompts to ensure they work as intended and refine them based on the outcomes.


### These are some common prompting techniques:

| Prompting Technique | Description | Good Example | Bad Example |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Write Clear Instructions | Be explicit about what you want the AI to do. Provide details to avoid ambiguity. Demonstrate the desired format if necessary. | "Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and explain each step." | "Write code." |
| Provide Reference Text | Supply trusted information to guide the AI's responses. Instruct the AI to use the reference text to answer questions. | "Using the information provided in the attached document, answer the following question..." | "Answer the question." |
| Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks | Break down tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Use the outputs of earlier tasks as inputs for subsequent ones. | Step 1: "Summarize the first paragraph of the text." Step 2: "Using the summary from Step 1, explain the main argument." | "Explain the text." |
| Give the Model Time to "Think" | Encourage the AI to reason through a problem before providing an answer. Request a "chain of thought" to improve the accuracy of responses. | "Before answering, list the steps you would take to solve this problem." | "Just answer the question." |


## Interactive Prompt-Writing Activities

Interactive prompt-writing activities are designed to enhance the skills of crafting effective prompts by engaging in practical exercises. These activities involve creating prompts, using them with AI, and then refining the prompts based on the AI's responses. The goal is to learn through experience and improve the ability to communicate with AI systems.

## Practice Session:

In a practice session, participants are given a task and asked to craft a prompt that will guide the AI to complete the task successfully. The AI's responses are then used as feedback to refine and improve the prompt. This iterative process helps in understanding how different phrasings, levels of detail, and structures can affect the AI's output.

Here's how you can conduct an interactive prompt-writing activity:

1. **Identify the Task**: Clearly define the task you want the AI to perform. It could be anything from writing a poem to solving a math problem.

2. **Craft the Initial Prompt**: Write a prompt that you think will lead the AI to complete the task. Be as clear and specific as possible.

3. **Test the Prompt**: Use the prompt with the AI and observe the response. Is it what you expected? Does it fulfill the task requirements?

4. **Analyze the Response**: Look at the AI's response critically. Identify areas where the prompt could be improved to get a better response.

5. **Refine the Prompt**: Based on the analysis, make changes to the prompt. This could involve adding more detail, rephrasing for clarity, or breaking down the task into subtasks.

6. **Repeat**: Test the refined prompt with the AI. Continue the cycle of testing and refining until the AI's response meets the task requirements satisfactorily.

7. **Discuss**: If this is done in a group setting, discuss the different prompts and responses. Compare approaches and share insights on what worked and what didn't.

## Example Activity:
Task: Write a poem about the sunset.

**Initial Prompt**: "Write a poem."
**Refined Prompt**: "Write a four-line poem that captures the beauty of a sunset, using vivid imagery and metaphor."
**AI Response**: "The sun dips low, a fiery glow, / Painting the sky in shades of ember, / Day's last breath, a whisper of light, / Night's embrace, as we remember."
**Analysis**: The refined prompt led to a more specific and imagery-rich poem that effectively captures the essence of a sunset.
