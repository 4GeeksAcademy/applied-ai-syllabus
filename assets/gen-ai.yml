      bio: | 
        My name is Charly, I like numbers, cooking, music, and sleeping in the mountains. I have been working as a full-stack developer for 3 years in various programming languages.

        One of the apps I have developed allows you to learn programming interactively, with an integrated AI tutor, and many ways to help the student. It currently has over 20,000 active users per month, helping each user personally thanks to advanced techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation.

        I have also developed a multimodal agent capable of executing SQL queries, performing data analysis and engineering, and using semantic search to specifically meet each requirement.

        I will teach you everything I know about AI applications in this course, are you ready?
